# Genetic Algorithm Mice

[![View Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Demo-brightgreen)](https://muj-mohmand.github.io/genetic-algo-mice/genetic-algorithm/)

A pathfinding solution using genetic algorithms! In this interactive simulation, mice evolve over generations to become smarter and better at reaching their goal‚Äîrepresented by the yellow square (cheese). 

Inspired by my introduction to AI course and the *Nature of Code* series, this project demonstrates how genetic algorithms can simulate evolution and adaptive behavior.

## üê≠ Features
- **Mice Evolution**: Mice evolve over time, learning how to navigate obstacles and reach the target.
- **Obstacle Placement**: Add mouse traps as stationary obstacles to challenge the mice.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Introduce snakes as moving obstacles that also evolve to become better hunters.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Watch as the generations progress, with improved performance as the mice evolve.

## üéÆ How It Works
1. **Selection**: Mice closer to the target have a higher chance of passing their genes to the next generation.
2. **Crossover**: Genes from the selected mice combine to create offspring.
3. **Mutation**: Random changes in genes introduce variety and help explore new solutions.
4. **Generational Progression**: Over successive generations, the mice get better at avoiding obstacles and reaching the target.
